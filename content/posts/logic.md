[Here](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/blog-dal/raw/master/static/slides/logic.pdf)â€™s the slides from the Introduction to Logic class. Also, some videos discussing some paradox with infinity.
\
\
The first one gives a proof of Cantor's famous proof that there's different types of infinity (proof done by contradiction) :

\
The second one (a bit long, but very interesting) concern another famous theorem, the Banach-Tarski Theorem. Really nice video showing the link between this result and Cantor's Theorem :

\
The last one is also on the Banach-Tarski Theorem (also a bit long) but explain more how this theorem is dependent on the Axiom of choice. Unfortunately this video is in French but very well done :

Enjoy!
